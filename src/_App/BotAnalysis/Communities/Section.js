                        After <a href="/bot-classification">identifying the bots</a>, we re-examined their retweet behavior to discern who they were retweeting, and how often.
                        {" "}Then for each pair of bots, we compared their retweet beneficiaries to produce a <a href="https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/jaccard-index">Jaccard coefficient</a> (similarity score) between each bot pair.

                    <Card.Text>
                        We filtered out bots whose behavior wasn't significantly similar to any others,
                        {" "} and grouped the remaining 681 bots into a given number of like communities, using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_clustering">Spectral Clustering</a> method (similar to K-Means Clustering).
                        {" "} We chose to separate the bots into two communities, to reflect the bipartisan nature of US politics.
